An application to utilize the smartphoneâ€™s internal GPS to accurately provide the real time location of the bus facilitating the end users to plan their trips more effectively and decreasing the waiting time in the stops. Deployed cron-job in Heroku to log the location of the buses, to later predict the travel time between stops.
